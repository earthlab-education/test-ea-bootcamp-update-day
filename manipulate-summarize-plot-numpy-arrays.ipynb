    "##  Indexing For Numpy Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lessons on lists, you learned that `Python` indexing begins with `[0]`, and that you can use indexing to query the value of items within `Python` lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also access elements (i.e. values) in `numpy arrays` using indexing. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### One-dimensional Numpy Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "For one-dimensional `numpy arrays`, you only need to specific one index value to access the elements in the `numpy array` (e.g.  `arrayname[index,]`). \n",
    "\n",
    "The example below is an one-dimensional array that has 3 elements, or values. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "avg_monthly_precip = numpy.array([0.70, 0.75, 1.85])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `avg_monthly_precip[2,]` to get the third element in (`1.85`) from this one-dimensional `numpy array`. \n",

    "### Two-dimensional Numpy Arrays\n",

    "```python\n",

    "                              [0.27, 1.13, 1.72]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `precip_2002_2013[1, 2]` to get the element in the second row, third column (`1.72`) of this two-dimensional `numpy array`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like you saw for the one-dimensional `numpy array`, you use the index `[1,2]` for the second row and third column because `Python` indexing begins with `[0]`, not with `[1]`\n",
    "\n",
